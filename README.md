This code is the implements of ["Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Multi-feature Fusion Residual Hypergraph Convolution Network" in 2023 8th International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP 2023)]

## Requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Hyperspectral datasets

Several public hyperspectral datasets are available on the [UPV/EHU](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes) wiki. Users can download those beforehand. The default dataset folder is `./Datasets/`.
